                         PROGRAMMING EXERCISES CHAPTER 4

5.  The CandyBar structure contains three members. The first member holds the
    brand name of a candy bar. The second member holds the weight (which may
    have a fractional part) of the candy bar, and the third member holds the
    number of calories (an integer value) in the candy bar. Write a program that
    declares such a structure and creates a CandyBar variable called snack,
    initializing its members to "Mocha Munch", 2.3, and 350, respectively. The
    initialization should be part of the declaration for snack. Finally, the
    program should display the contents of the snack variable.

6.  The CandyBar structure contains three members, as described in Programming
    Exercise 5. Write a program that creates an array of three CandyBar
    structures, initializes them to values of your choice, and then displays the
    contents of each structure.

7.  William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he needs to
    record the following information:

    The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than one word
    The diameter of the pizza
    The weight of the pizza

    Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program that
    uses a structure variable of that type. The program should ask the user to
    enter each of the preceding items of information, and then the program
    should display that information. Use cin (or its methods) and cout.

8.  Do Programming Exercise 7 but use new to allocate a structure instead of
    declaring a structure variable. Also have the program request the pizza
    diameter before it requests the pizza company name.

9.  Do Programming Exercise 6, but instead of declaring an array of three
    CandyBar structures, use new to allocate the array dynamically.

10. Write a program that requests the user to enter three times for the 40-yd
    dash (or 40-meter, if you prefer) and then displays the times and the
    average. Use an array object to hold the data. (Use a built-in array if
    array is not available.)
